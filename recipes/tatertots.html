    <ol>
      <li>Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and cook until parboiled, about 6-7 minutes; drain well and let cool. </li>
      <br />
      <li> Using a box grater, finely shred potatoes. Using a clean dish towel or cheese cloth, drain potatoes completely, removing as much water as possible. </li>

      <li> Transfer potatoes to a large bowl. Stir in flour, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and dill; season with salt and pepper, to taste. The mixture should be workable but dry. Form potatoes into tots. </li>

      <li> Heat vegetable oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. </li>
      <br />
      <li>Add tots to the skillet, 5 or 6 at a time, and cook until evenly golden and crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
      <br />
      <li> Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired. </li>
